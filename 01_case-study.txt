Case Study #1

As an experienced professional in the software industry, you are currently employed at a company that has developed its own software solution,
integrating various third-party software components. Recently, your team encountered a significant challenge with one of your third-party software providers.
The provider notified you that they would cease support for your current implementation and required you to upgrade your codebase to align with their new implementation standards.

This unexpected development prompted your team to reflect on your processes and consider preventive measures to mitigate similar challenges in the future.
While this issue primarily concerns the third-party software provider, it raises questions about your approach to software integration and dependency management.

For this activity, simply choose one question you wish to answer.

1. What initial steps could your team have taken to anticipate potential changes or discontinuation of support from third-party software providers?
2. How can you improve your communication and relationship with third-party software providers to stay informed about upcoming changes or updates?
3. In what ways can you enhance your software architecture and design to minimize dependencies on external components and facilitate easier migration when necessary?
4. What strategies can you implement to ensure timely updates and maintenance of your software to adapt to changes in third-party software requirements?
5. Reflecting on your experience, what lessons have you learned, and what actionable steps can you take to prevent similar issues in the future?

1. Having an early warning system is a great asset for a company. Especially a software industry, an early warning system is not specifically a system but a department 
   where the workers are researchers and understanding the current trends. Knowing the current trends will help mitigate the damage of a distruptive innovation.
   By understanding the technology that the company is using, the company can create an adaptable system.
